# Introduction
We propose a Sequential Motion Optimization (SMO) to strengthen gradient-based methods. The key idea of SMO is inspired from a movement mechanism in a recent metaheuristic method called Balancing Composite Motion Optimization (BCMO). 
Specifically, SMO establishes a sequential motion chain of two gradientguided individuals including a leader and a follower to enhance the effectiveness of parameter updates in each iteration.
